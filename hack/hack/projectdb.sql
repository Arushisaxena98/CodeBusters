(1, 'AI Research Projects', 'Automated Planning & Control', 'Automated Planning and Control study the computational process of generating a plan, a course of action for an agent to execute towards achieving its goal or objective. Historically, planning and control communities have respectively focused on discrete and continuous state/action spaces, though this difference is reducing slowly. The planning group at the University of Washington has been active in the development of planning algorithms and representations since 1990. This historical website lists the earlier projects, publications, and download links. '),

We are currently working to define large-scale joint initiatives that will enable us to leverage our multi-disciplinary expertise to attack the most challenging problems in field.\r\n'),
(3, 'AI Research Projects', 'Brain-Computer Interfaces & Computational Neuroscience', 'In 2006, our group became one of the first to demonstrate the control of a humanoid robot using a non-invasive brain computer interface (BCI). The system consists of a robot, an electrode cap for sensing brainwaves, and a graphical user interface for controlling the robot remotely. Our original research demonstrated that the BCI can be used to command a HOAP-2 humanoid robot to select and fetch desired objects from remote locations. We have more recently proposed a framework for adaptive hierarchical brain-computer interfacing that allows the user to teach a robot new behaviors on-the-fly. '),

An approach that can robustly infer the pathways that can define disease processes will dramatically improve our understanding of diseases and advance personalized medicine in its treatment. We aim to realize this goal by using modern, advanced machine learning techniques.'),

(10, 'COMPUTER SIMULATION', 'A tax simulation system', ' Another continuing debate is whether to increase taxes. By increasing taxes we mean increasing the tax rate. The question is whether this will raise revenue or decrease revenue (the actual number of tax dollars collected). There are a number of possibilities (1) increasing business income tax vs. businesses moving, (2) increasing personal income tax vs. people moving, (3) creating an internet sales tax. In each of these cases your model probably needs to consider the proportion of local to national businesses and the proportion of people willing to move locally or move nationally for a job.\r\n'),

When customers arrive, they check in at the main podium and give their name, number of people in the party, and smoking preference. Some will go to the bar and may or may not choose to eat there instead of waiting for a table. Others will simply sit in benches, waiting for their party to be called. When a party is seated, they should have some random eating time (or you might want to simulate the eating process in more detail -- ordering, salad, entree, dessert, etc.) before leaving. Tables and seats in the bar would be resources here. What if a party of 20 shows up? Can some tables (resources) be pushed together to accommodate large parties?'),
